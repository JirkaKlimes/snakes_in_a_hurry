My friend and I are marking the end of our dorm life as we began it: by developing neural networks to play the game of Snake. Having started our journey into neural networks when we first met, we now bring an enhanced understanding and the use of CUDA for optimization, ensuring the snakes in "Snakes in a Hurry" operate at supercharged speeds. This project is not only a testament to our growth in knowledge but also a fitting tribute to our time together.
